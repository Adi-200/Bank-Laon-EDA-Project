# Bank_Loan_EDA_Project

####  This project uses SQL to analyze a bank loan dataset, focusing on metrics such as total and monthly loan applications, funded amounts, and payments. It includes assessments of average interest rates, debt-to-income ratios, and loan status performance (good vs. bad). The analysis also explores loan distributions by state, employment length, loan purpose, and home ownership.
